Similarly, short-term loans (also called payday loans) are considered predatory because they charge exorbitant fees of up to 400% on average. These loans also demand total repayment in the short term, or steeper penalties are imposed. Several states have banned the use of short-term loans to protect consumers.
Title loans are another emergency option that requires an asset, such as a car title, as collateral. These loans are similar to payday loans in that you can get money quickly, but at very poor interest rates and terms. If you're unable to repay the loan (with all the accrued interest), you lose the title. Again, many states prohibit the use of title loans.
