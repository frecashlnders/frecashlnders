Personal loans might be one of the most popular types of emergency loans since they're widely available and flexible. With a personal loan, you take out a specific sum of money and make regular payments every month. You can use the funds for anything you like, which makes them perfect for financial emergencies. Personal loans generally have more agreeable terms than credit card cash advances or short-term loans.
Credit card cash advances are convenient since you can simply withdraw money at an ATM using your credit card. However, the interest rate on cash advances is much higher than what you'd get for a personal loan, and interest is charged immediately, not after the grace period.
